Lessons from Fooling Some of the People All of the Time


## The Other Side of the Trade

Einhorn tells a story when he was asked to meet with an investor who was long Allied Capital. He'd prepared a large briefcase full of notes and reports on his findings. To his surprise the other investor showed up unprepared and with no research of his own and only had a unrelated cursory reason for owning shares.

It is a belief that buying shares of a company is inherently an arrogant act because it goes against the wisdom of the markets. Market's goals being to eliminate large discrepancies in price and to prevent large profits gained.

Einhorn too believed this, that in a transaction the counterparty also believes they are getting the better of the deal and must have their own qualified research. Who we are up against is also just as prepared as we are.

The experience that occurred though that this wasn't true and can commonly occur. We cannot reasonably expect all buyers/sellers to have the same strength of research, but surprisingly here was the second largest shareholder of Allied Capital that had not done this.

Einhorn concludes the following
"I left with a new understanding of what we were up against. It wasn’t an issue of investors understanding our views and disagreeing. In addition to the small investors, Allied’s other investors were big funds managing lots of other people’s money—too busy or too lazy to worry about the details, other than the tax distribution."

## Challenges occur no matter how talented you are

In the book, David Einhorn is already a distinguished investor and on his way to legendary status.

He already already has the personal talent, built the talent at his firm, a powerful track record and the personal morals and thinking that deserves great trust from client. Any change he would want to make in his firm, he can.

The story though is of despite all these things and with a strong well reasoned case, he came through it facing tremendous adversity.

- His wife loses her job.
- He personally comes under attack many times as a result
- It was his first public investing pitch and he had been invited to speak by chance. It had started as a small idea at a charity conference that had huge backlash for a person who prefers to remain private

The book ends  with the fate of Allied Capital unknown and that through all this effort he had not been vindicated.

It's an interesting read to hear about people at the top of their vocation to face the same struggles that we do. And that's this doesn't change no matter how far you go.
