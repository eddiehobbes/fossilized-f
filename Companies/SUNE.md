# Idea
Solar is a long maligned idea. Usually viewed with skepticism or economically unviable.

## Solar Business Models

### Residential Model
Viewed as flawed by Jim Chanos. You as a home owner put no money down to install solar on your house from a residential model solar company, you then have lease payments to the solar companies and pay a reduced electrical bill. The bad assumption that might be being made here is that your locked into this contract for time and pay lease payments on solar panels that are depreciating assets. They are depreciating because newer and cheaper solar panels advance quickly. Solar company also relies on being able to re-lease the panels at the end of the contract(20 years). Belief is that solar will advance so much technologically in the time that the panels will be worthless. Solar company assumes risk of paying for installation on homes.

### Commercial Model

# Sunedison Profile
Company does not manufacture solar products. Exclusively a developer of solar projects. SUNE finds opportunities for solar. Acquires land/rooftops and permits to build solar plant. Finds a business/utility to buy the electricity for a 20 year term. Borrows money and constructs the plant. And then sells the plant usually to Terraform.

## Terraform Power and Terraform Global
Buys and owns solar projects that SUNE develops. Mainly pays out dividend to shareholders. SUNE owns IDR(incentive distribution rights) in Terraform which is a share of Terraform profits that increases payments to SUNE as Terraform grows it's dividend. SUNE collects profits when Terraform's dividend increases 50% and collects half of Terraform cash flow when it doubles.

## Joint venture with Samsung for poly-silicon manufacturing
Polysilicon is used for solar photovolatic and electronics.

## SunEdison semiconductor
Manufacturing arm of SUNE. A separate company.

## SUNE relationship with Terraform yieldco's
1. SUNE will secure financing and builds the solar development
  1. SUNE borrows debt + uses profits to fund solar development
  2. SUNE focused on selling solar development for a price > cost to build
  3. Assume SUNE is good/exceptional at acquiring land + permits vs. other companies
  4. This includes a contract to buy the power generated
2. SUNE sells the solar development to a company that will manage it
  1. SUNE does not want the risk of managing solar development and it's output
  2. SUNE depends on Terraform Power / Terraform Global / Other investor to purchase solar development profitably from SUNE
  4. SUNE reinvests profit to develop more solar projects
3. Terraform buys the solar development
  1. Terraform manages the solar development and collects the payments for the electricity sold
  2. Terraform has a reliable stream of profit to distribute dividends and predictable expenses making it's shares and cost of capital attractive
  3. Terraform is required? to pay out 85% of it's cashflow as dividends
  4. To buy more solar developments, Terraform uses it's low cost of capital + attractive share price to raise $$$
4. Process
  1. As Terraform increases their payouts, SUNE collects money from Terraform's cashflow as part of an IDR(Incentive Distribution Right) with Terraform
  2. Semiconductor technology improvements reduce the cost of building solar developments



### Obstacles
- Risk of massive debt
- Dependent on spinoff yieldco companies to purchase completed solar developments
- Spinoff yieldco's require low interest debt to buy solar developments or a high stock price to issue equity. Both of these avenue's
- Lawsuit risk to conflict of interest between SUNE and yieldco's. Allegation that SUNE is influencing yieldco to overpay for solar developments
- Questionable acquisition of Vivint solar(A residential model solar company) for 2.2 billion dollars

### Anchors
- Company consolidates company's interests in public companies in its balance sheets and non-recourse debt
- Complicated company structure
- Massive Debt

### Wind
- Many solar companies are driven by the idea of renewable energy. SUNE is a spinoff of Mosaic corporation, which makes management more business minded and experienced rather than solar companies that simply believe in solar or companies that are attempting to grab at subsidies.
- Rapid advances in semiconductor innovation decreasing cost of solar.
- Drop in oil prices. Oil is mainly used for transportation, not electricity generation. Oil is only 4% of electricity production globally.
- More than half of new electricity capacity in the U.S. this year will be solar.
- Already stronger internationally and has expertise in dealing with industrial clients. (U.S. is 46% of SUNE projects)
- Vertically integrated, already controls aspects of R&D, manufacturing, solar project development and ownership in the company and subsidiaries.
- Other solar companies compete with wholesale sources of electricity. SUNE sells to industrial customers like airports or big box stores that buy electricity at retail prices(better margins). Wholesale electricity is sold to transmission, electricity is sold directly to client.
- IDR rights in Terraform, this is an increase of payments to SUNE when Terraform begins to raise their divident payout.

## Further Research and notes
Need to discover the amount of Non-recourse debt(Debt of which SUNE is not personally liable, but secured with collateral) and of that is the large debt that SUNE has.
My three favorite investors have positions in parts of the company. Seth Klarman is long SunEdison semiconductor, David Einhorn(author of presentation) is long SUNE and Jim Chanos is long SUNE, while short SolarCity.

Update notes

## Conclusion
Purchase of shares. Risk is high. A lot of uncertainty and volatility. Very interesting idea, but notes are nearly a year old.
The main and real fears are that the Vivint acquisition was a bad ownership, SUNE has overwhelming debt and that their relationship with Terraform is inappropriate

# Post Mortem

SUNE filed for Chapter 11th bankruptcy in early 2016. This will be the largest bankruptcy in U.S. market in some time. The cause of the bankruptcy is a liquidity issue from too much debt burden and inability to complete and sell projects. Noting the projects were good ones and as far as we know the company's business itself was not fraudulent, but that the representation of their financial state was as well as their relationship between SUNE and two yieldco's. Acquisition discipline slipped and a number of deals became more Questionable.

## Jim Chanos comments on SUNE
Jim Chanos commented on CNBC on positive financials for SUNE while commenting on his short of SolarCity. Chanos bought SUNE in Q4 2014, but had sold out within 3 quarters for losses. I had watched the CNBC interview, but not noticed he had sold in the time in between.

## David Tepper lawsuit of TERP conflict of interest
Hedge fund manager David Tepper who is also held in high regard took a large stake in the yieldco Terraform and was unhappy with the proposed Vivint acquisition because SUNE was to have Terraform buy Vivint assets for for cash for itself. He is spearheading a lawsuit that states that SUNE abused it's relationship with Terraform and is trying to (rightfully) get clarified financial statements released.

## David Einhorn
David Einhorn is my favorite investor today. What is interesting about this in the past few years he's engaged with bloggers frequently to discuss rebuttals to his ideas. Notably a few that have gone sour and will list those discussions here.

- [DE response Vienna Capitalist on Greek Piraeus Bank](https://viennacapitalist.com/2014/11/19/my-response-to-david-einhorns-comments-part-1/)
- [DE posting as davideinhornnyc in comment section on Consol Energy](https://valueandopportunity.com/2015/11/19/dear-david-einhorn-why-are-your-interns-doing-all-the-cost-of-capital-estimates-consol-energy/)

Keeping admiration of David and noting that these are discussions, but apparently the blogs we read intersect a lot more than I thought.

## Cancellation of Acquisition of Vivint Solar
Our view on Vivint Solar that this was a bad transaction and was moving  

Despite dire financial straits, SUNE shareholders to my own surprise overwhelmingly voted in favor of acquiring Vivint Solar. Vivint Solar itself terminated the deal after SUNE failed to close on the acquisition.

## SUNE Debt
SUNE started to take high interest debt to address liquidity with heavily dilutive convertible debt and second lien debt at interest rates at ~9.25%.

## Facts inclining us to lean SUNE and signs ignored
- CEO Ahmad Chatila often refused salary in favor of SUNE and had no large dispositions of shares since
- Executive board reshuffle, Executives of Terraform and Terraform Global replaced, resignations of protesting directors at SUNE
- Purchased projects themselves were good, which gave a false sense of security addressing the overall debt.
- Greenlight able to appoint independent director in January 2016, but was already too late.
- Delay of annual report twice after reported weakness in financial reporting
- Lawsuit on misrepresentation of cash reserves of over $1 billion
- Reality that yieldco's could issue shares to finance purchases was not a reality very quickly and broke one of critical assumptions
- Because of oil crash and market reducing Terraform company share prices the Incentive Distribution Rights(IDRs) never materialized.

## Unfortunately in Good Company
We find ourselves in this bad situation with good company. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Jim Chanos of Kynikos as well as many other respected investors were caught up in the bankruptcy. Well respected is being stressed here as many of the best and most scrutinous minds on financial fraud
