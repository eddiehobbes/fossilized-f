# Idea
Solar is a long maligned idea. Usually viewed with skepticism or economically unviable.

## Solar Business Models

### Residential Model
Viewed as flawed by Jim Chanos. You as a home owner put no money down to install solar on your house from a residential model solar company, you then have lease payments to the solar companies and pay a reduced electrical bill. The bad assumption that might be being made here is that your locked into this contract for time and pay lease payments on solar panels that are depreciating assets. They are depreciating because newer and cheaper solar panels advance quickly. Solar company also relies on being able to re-lease the panels at the end of the contract(20 years). Belief is that solar will advance so much technologically in the time that the panels will be worthless. Solar company assumes risk of paying for installation on homes.

### Commercial Model

# Sunedison Profile
Company does not manufacture solar products. Exclusively a developer of solar projects. SUNE finds opportunities for solar. Acquires land/rooftops and permits to build solar plant. Finds a business/utility to buy the electricity for a 20 year term. Borrows money and constructs the plant. And then sells the plant usually to Terraform.

## Terraform Power and Terraform Global
Buys and owns solar projects that SUNE develops. Mainly pays out dividend to shareholders. SUNE owns IDR(incentive distribution rights) in Terraform which is a share of Terraform profits that increases payments to SUNE as Terraform grows it's dividend. SUNE collects profits when Terraform's dividend increases 50% and collects half of Terraform cash flow when it doubles.

## Joint venture with Samsung for poly-silicon manufacturing
Polysilicon is used for solar photovolatic and electronics.

## SunEdison semiconductor
Manufacturing arm of SUNE. A separate company.

## SUNE relationship with Terraform yieldco's
1. SUNE will secure financing and builds the solar development
  1. SUNE borrows debt + uses profits to fund solar development
  2. SUNE focused on selling solar development for a price > cost to build
  3. Assume SUNE is good/exceptional at acquiring land + permits vs. other companies
  4. This includes a contract to buy the power generated
2. SUNE sells the solar development to a company that will manage it
  1. SUNE does not want the risk of managing solar development and it's output
  2. SUNE depends on Terraform Power / Terraform Global / Other investor to purchase solar development profitably from SUNE
  4. SUNE reinvests profit to develop more solar projects
3. Terraform buys the solar development
  1. Terraform manages the solar development and collects the payments for the electricity sold
  2. Terraform has a reliable stream of profit to distribute dividends and predictable expenses making it's shares and cost of capital attractive
  3. Terraform is required? to pay out 85% of it's cashflow as dividends
  4. To buy more solar developments, Terraform uses it's low cost of capital + attractive share price to raise $$$
4. Process
  1. As Terraform increases their payouts, SUNE collects money from Terraform's cashflow as part of an IDR(Incentive Distribution Right) with Terraform
  2. Semiconductor technology improvements reduce the cost of building solar developments



### Obstacles
- Risk of massive debt
- Dependent on spinoff yieldco companies to purchase completed solar developments
- Spinoff yieldco's require low interest debt to buy solar developments or a high stock price to issue equity. Both of these avenue's
- Lawsuit risk to conflict of interest between SUNE and yieldco's. Allegation that SUNE is influencing yieldco to overpay for solar developments
- Questionable acquisition of Vivint solar(A residential model solar company) for 2.2 billion dollars

### Anchors
- Company consolidates company's interests in public companies in its balance sheets and non-recourse debt
- Complicated company structure
- Massive Debt

### Wind
- Many solar companies are driven by the idea of renewable energy. SUNE is a spinoff of Mosaic corporation, which makes management more business minded and experienced rather than solar companies that simply believe in solar or companies that are attempting to grab at subsidies.
- Rapid advances in semiconductor innovation decreasing cost of solar.
- Drop in oil prices. Oil is mainly used for transportation, not electricity generation. Oil is only 4% of electricity production globally.
- More than half of new electricity capacity in the U.S. this year will be solar.
- Already stronger internationally and has expertise in dealing with industrial clients. (U.S. is 46% of SUNE projects)
- Vertically integrated, already controls aspects of R&D, manufacturing, solar project development and ownership in the company and subsidiaries.
- Other solar companies compete with wholesale sources of electricity. SUNE sells to industrial customers like airports or big box stores that buy electricity at retail prices(better margins). Wholesale electricity is sold to transmission, electricity is sold directly to client.
- IDR rights in Terraform, this is an increase of payments to SUNE when Terraform begins to raise their divident payout.

## Further Research and notes
Need to discover the amount of Non-recourse debt(Debt of which SUNE is not personally liable, but secured with collateral) and of that is the large debt that SUNE has.
My three favorite investors have positions in parts of the company. Seth Klarman is long SunEdison semiconductor, David Einhorn(author of presentation) is long SUNE and Jim Chanos is long SUNE, while short SolarCity.

Update notes

## Conclusion
Purchase of shares. Risk is high. A lot of uncertainty and volatility. Very interesting idea, but notes are nearly a year old.
The main and real fears are that the Vivint acquisition was a bad ownership, SUNE has overwhelming debt and that their relationship with Terraform is inappropriate
